## Know issues
- Bunnies can beat the high score once by being stupid
(i.e always jumping), then the mutations will likely
not be enough to change their synapses and beat the high score again;

## TODO
- If bunnies are not beating highscore after several tries,
some should mutate more.

- Default mutations values are to high, only one bunnies
keeps going a long time.
Most of all mutated dies too soon.

- Clean code
